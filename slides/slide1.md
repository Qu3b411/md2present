# Terminal Slide Deck Framework

Welcome to the **Terminal Slide Deck Framework**, a minimalist presentation
engine that renders Markdown slides inside a persistent terminal container.
Instead of flipping pages like a conventional slideshow, each slide appears
as output in a console window with a monospace font and blinking caret.

This deck teaches you how to use and customise the framework itself.  Use
the arrow keys or dropdown to explore.
