# Security Policy

This project is a local framework for generating a static `index.html` slide deck, intended for personal use in talks, conferences, and similar venues.

It is designed for **single-author, local execution**. Slide content is treated as **trusted input**, and raw HTML/JavaScript is allowed intentionally to support interactive and terminal-style slides.

This project is shared publicly because it may be useful to others, not as a supported product or service.

This project does **not** operate sensitive infrastructure. Security-related discussions and reports may be made public via standard GitHub issues.
